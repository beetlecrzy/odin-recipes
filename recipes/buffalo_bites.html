            <li>3 1/2 cups Vegetable Oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the bleu cheese dip. Add 3 oz bleu 
                cheese, 2/3 cup mayo, 6 T sour cream, 1 1/2 T 
                cider vinegar, 1/2 tsp pepper, and a pinch of 
                salt and pinch of garlic powder to a food 
                processor. Process until smooth and 
                incorporated. Store in the fridge until ready 
                to use. </li>
            <li>Prepare the chicken. Add 1/2 cup buttermilk, 1 1/2 
                tsp salt, and about 2 large chicken breasts cut 
                into chunks into a large ziplock bag. Let marinate 
                in the fridge for 1-2 hours. </li>
            <li>Make the buffalo chicken sauce. To a small 
                saucepan, add 2/3 cup hot sauce, 1/3 cup water, 
                1/2 tsp sugar, 1 T butter, and 3 tsp corn starch. 
                Cook over medium heat and whisk to combine. Once 
                thickened, remove from the heat and set aside. </li>
            <li>Prepare to bread the chicken. Add 4 egg whites to 
                a small bowl and whisk until foamy. In a medium 
                bowl, add 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1 1/2 
                cups cornstarch, and 1/3 cup of the buffalo chicken 
                sauce from the saucepan. Mix until the mixture 
                resembles cornmeal.</li>
            <li>Bread the chicken. Remove the chicken breast pieces 
                from the buttermilk marinade and lightly pat dry 
                with paper towels. Toss half of the chicken into the 
                egg whites, coating all the chicken. Transfer to the 
                flour mixture and make sure each piece of chicken is 
                fully coated. Gently press the flour mixture to the 
                chicken pieces to more fully adhere it. Transfer 
                chicken to a separate plate. Repeat with all the 
                chicken. 
            <li>Pan fry the buffalo chicken bites in batches. Heat 3 
                1/2 cups vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven over 
                medium heat. Use an instant read thermometer to heat 
                the oil to 350ºF. Cook half of the chicken bites for 
                2 minutes, flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes. 
                Place chicken on a plate lined with paper towels. 
                Make sure oil reaches 350ºF before adding the next 
                batch of chicken. Repeat. </li>
            <li>Coat chicken bites in buffalo sauce. Warm the sauce 
                in the saucepan back up. Place the buffalo chicken 
                bites in a large bowl and pour the buffalo sauce on 
                top. Toss the chicken until all pieces are fully 
                coated. Serve with homemade bleu cheese dressing or 
                your favorite dipping sauce. Enjoy! </li>
